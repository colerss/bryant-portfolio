  "Biography": "I consider myself to be a highly driven and studious worker, possessing an excentric demeanor and boundless optimism. Past colleagues and classmates would describe me as an animated, hardworking and thorough. I'm a big teamplayer and always strife to assure that everyone feels valued by the team and engaged with our project, which may or may not include treating everyone to a batch of freshly baked pastries.",
  "About My Hobbies": "Aside individual projects to keep my programming skills on-point such as unity game development, I spent my free time between playing video games, going to the gym and baking a variety of delicious pastries each week. These quite often come in batches far too large that would be quite disastrous to the diet of my family, and so, it is quite common for me to go to my friends and colleagues and spread around the fruits of my labor. ",
  "Bachelor AP": "My initial start after secondary education was a 3 year swing at a Bachelors degree. Despite a stellar first year, personal circumstances led to a burnout during the second year. I kept putting myself in stressful situations through rampant procrastination that quickly became unmanageable during the second year, and had slowly been alienating what few friends I managed to make. After starting with psychological aid and medication after a year of struggle, I realized my passion for IT was (for now) extinguished, and I took the second semester as a sabbatical, working to get my mental health and motivation to the unshakable flame it is now known as.",
  "Bachelor Psychology": "To sharpen up my social skills and communicative capabilities, I then started this bachelor. Newly motivated and having learned the harsh lessons of my first bachelor, I applied myself socially with great success. The character development displayed during this year has truly been life changing. Alas, the bachelor was doomed; once we left the theoretical and started with the practical, it became obvious I still had much to learn, more than I could within the few months afforded to me. After a particularly catastrophic failure of a practical exam, I had to face reality and move back into my lane. With this new life experience and a renewed motivation, I returned to programming with a vengeance!",
  "Graduate Programming": "From the start all up until the end of the course, I stood as one of the top programmers of my class. Previously hobbled with a lack of motivation, rampant procrastination and a total lack of social initiative, I now attend to my studies with a vigor that would have been alien to my past self, see my projects delivered on time and with grace, and have stepped up to become a pillar of the classroom, making friends wherever I go. Truly, these two years have been among finest, and there is no doubt about my career as a programmer. At the end of the trajectory, I proudly graduated with great distinction.",
  "Bachelor Programming":"And off to new horizons we went! With energy left in my heart and future employers to impress, I resolutely have gone on to extend my graduate degree with the accolades of the bachelor degree. After my first year, I once again showed my strengths by averaging out on a phenomenal 77% score. Even my French course, something I didn't have for 6 years and wasn't particularly good at at the end of my secondary education, didn't hamper my momentum. I feel confident in again, with distinction, finishing this degree without delay before boldly stepping into the labor market!",
  "Certiline":"My very first work experience, where I took care of troubleshooting and optimizing the pcâ€™s and laptops of private customers, as well as aiding and assisting in the deployment and configuration of business networks. This was a simple short-duration internship as part of my secondary education.",
  "Almet":"After putting a stop to my first bachelor, I took on this job to close the gap between this and the next bachelor. It turned out to revitalize my mental health and allowed me to finally give back to those near and dear to me. As warehouse assistant, I acted as all-round aid for the variety of assembly, production and lifting related tasks throughout the factory section of Almet.",
  "SoftAdvice":"Internship for the graduate degree. For this internship, I had to deliver a webportal for the Document Management System M-Files, to allow people without an M-Files license to access select files from a vault. I worked mostly independent, and was chiefly responsible for conceptualizing and planning the project.",
